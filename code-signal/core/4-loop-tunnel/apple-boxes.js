// You have k apple boxes full of apples. Each square box of size m contains m Ã— m apples. You just noticed two interesting properties about the boxes:

// The smallest box is size 1, the next one is size 2,..., all the way up to size k.
// Boxes that have an odd size contain only yellow apples. Boxes that have an even size contain only red apples.
// Your task is to calculate the difference between the number of red apples and the number of yellow apples.

const appleBoxes = k => {
    let y=0, r=0
    for (let i=1;i<k+1;i++) {
        if (i&1) y+= i*i
        if (!(i&1)) r+= i*i
    }
    return r-y
